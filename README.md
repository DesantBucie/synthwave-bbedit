# SynthWave BBEdit Color Sheme(Theme)

## This is the theme I've created for BBEdit which idea is 
based on !(SynthWave'84 for VSCode)[https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode].

The idea is simple. Create a cool looking theme, that reminds you of 80's,
that you probably never lived. Not shiny, not glossy, just cool looking, neon like.

Although idea is based on !(Synthwave'84)[https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode]
this cannot have so many effects as i.e. BBEdit treats function name as plain text.

## The update.sh

I use the update.sh to update theme to git repository whenever I make a change,
If you see a field of improvement, tell me on issues or pull you changes.
